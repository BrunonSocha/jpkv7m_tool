## Sidenote

This project serves to aid my dad in tax reporting for our company, and as a revision of my Python skills (haven't touched Python in a long time). Because we don't use many of the functionalities of the JPK_V7M form, they won't be implemented at the beginning - with time I plan on expanding it - to handle different data, as well as handle JPK_V7K (or whatever the quarterly version is called).
